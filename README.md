# Bipolar-COVID19-Reddit-Analysis

## Project Description

This project analyzes Reddit posts related to bipolar disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to understand how the pandemic has affected individuals with bipolar disorder by examining trends in Reddit discussions. The analysis includes sentiment analysis and topic modeling of relevant posts.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- R (version 4.0.0 or higher)
- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Reddit API credentials (client ID, client secret, user agent)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository:

  `git clone https://github.com/jleibson/Bipolar-COVID19-Reddit-Analysis.git`

  `cd Bipolar-COVID19-Reddit-Analysis`

2. Install required R packages: 

`install.packages(c("tidyverse", "syuzhet", "topicmodels", "ggplot2", "plotly", "dplyr", "scales", "stringr", "lubridate", "tidyr", "readr", "textdata", "tm"))`

3. Install required Python packages:  `pip install praw pandas re nltk ssl`

4. Obtain Reddit API credentials:
    - Create a Reddit account if you don't have one already.
    - Go to https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
    - Scroll down and click on "create application".
    - Select "script" as the application type.
    - Set the redirect URI to http://localhost:8080
    - After creation, you'll receive your client ID and client secret.

5. Replace the placeholder values in `reddit_bipolar_data.py` with your actual Reddit API credentials.

  ```
  client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
  client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
  user_agent = "YOUR_USER_AGENT"
  ```
## Code Structure
- reddit_bipolar_data.py: Functions to collect and preprocess Reddit data
- bipolar_covid_analysis.R: Core analysis functions including sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and topic modeling
- visualization.R: Code for generating static and interactive plots

## Usage Instructions

1. Run the Python script to fetch data from Reddit: `python reddit_bipolar_data.py`

   This will generate a CSV file named `bipolar_covid_posts.csv`.

2. Run the R script to perform the analysis: `Rscript bipolar_covid_analysis.R`

This will generate various output files, including sentiment analysis results and topic models.

## Output File Descriptions

- `reddit_bipolar_data.py`: Python script to fetch data from Reddit using PRAW.
- `bipolar_covid_analysis.R`: R script that performs the main analysis, including sentiment analysis and topic modeling.
- `bipolar_covid_posts.csv`: Output file containing the fetched Reddit posts (generated by the Python script).
- `sentiment_analysis_report.txt`: Output file containing sentiment analysis results (generated by the R script).

## Challenges and Limitations
- Reddit API rate limits affect data collection speed
- Analysis is based on public posts, which may not represent all individuals with bipolar disorder
- Sentiment analysis tools may not fully capture the nuances of mental health discussions

## Key Variables
- sentiment_score: Sentiment score of each post (-1 to 1)
- emotion_categories: Detected emotions in each post
- post_date: Date of the Reddit post
- subreddit_subscribers: Number of subscribers to r/bipolar at the time of posting

## Key Findings
- Overall negative sentiment trend, worsening over time
- Dominant emotions: sadness, trust, and anticipation
- Key topics: COVID-19's impact on manic episodes, job security, and emotional experiences

## Results and Visualization
Our analysis revealed a declining trend in sentiment over the course of the pandemic. Here's a sample visualization of this trend:

## Significance and Conclusion
This analysis provides crucial insights into the mental health challenges faced by individuals with bipolar disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. By examining sentiment trends, emotional responses, and key discussion topics, we can better understand the unique struggles of this community. These findings can be valuable for:

1. Mental health professionals developing targeted interventions
2. Policymakers addressing the mental health impacts of global crises
3. Researchers studying the long-term effects of pandemics on vulnerable populations

The project demonstrates the potential of using social media data to gain real-time insights into mental health trends during unprecedented global events.

## Future Work
This project lays the groundwork for several important areas of future research:

1. **COVID-19 as a Trigger:** Investigate how COVID-19 may trigger or exacerbate bipolar disorder, even in individuals without prior psychiatric history. This could inform mental health screening protocols for COVID-19 patients.

2. **Bidirectional Relationship:** Explore the bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and mental health disorders, emphasizing the need for comprehensive care that addresses both physical and mental health in COVID-19 patients.

3. **Neurological Impact:** Study the potential neuroinvasive effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on the central nervous system, which may contribute to psychiatric symptoms. This opens avenues for neurological research in COVID-19-related mental health issues.

4. **Vulnerable Populations:** Further investigate why individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders, especially bipolar disorder, are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and poorer outcomes. This could inform targeted preventive measures and care strategies.

Additional future work could include:
- Comparative analysis with other mental health subreddits
- Integration of machine learning models for more nuanced sentiment classification
- Longitudinal study to track long-term mental health impacts post-pandemic
