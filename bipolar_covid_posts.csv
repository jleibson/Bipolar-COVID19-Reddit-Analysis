zydgvd,2022-12-29 13:09:10,"Hi all,

Wanted to hear about your related experience / whether this is normal.

I had covid \~3 weeks ago. I'm male/in my 30s so was not expecting it to be very intense or disruptive. I got sicker than I thought I would and it lasted about 5 days. However, my sleep and anxiety got thrown way out of whack by it. I have never had a full on manic episode in my life but after a couple of nights of not sleeping **at all** (very very unlike me) I had a funny feeling that I was on the verge of going in that direction. My doctor gave me gabapentin to sleep and reduced my welbutrin, hoping to decrease any stimulating effects. A little over a week later and I'm starting to sleep decently again but now I'm feeling pretty seriously depressed, like periods of desperation at a level of intensity that I haven't experienced in 5-6 years.

A little bit of backstory, I began seeking psychiatric care around 9 years ago for severe depression. At some point a doctor diagnosed me as bipolar ii, to which everyone in my family was like ""...you're not bipolar..."" I ignored them and embraced the diagnosis at the time and got on bipolar meds. They sort of stabilized me but never really took away the depression and also left me with a lot of very disruptive side effects. Over time I started feeling skeptical about the diagnosis. For example my therapist who I've been working with for 9 years doesn't think I remind her of her other bipolar patients and most conceptions of mania/hypomania don't map clearly to my past self. I wanted to see if I could be on less medication and I successfully went from 300mg/day of seroquel to no seroquel over the course of 2/3 years, seemingly without my mood being destabilized.

Around 3 months ago I asked my p doc to decrease my lithium. She suggested going from 1350mg/day to 900mg/day (side note: I've started wondering if that's an abnormally large jump for a psych med decrease, what do you think?). I trusted her suggestion and carried out the decrease. I felt a little panicky at moments during the first month or so but this feeling went away. Sleep was a little bit lighter but not so much that I thought it was a real problem. Even while at my highest levels of being medicated I would still have regular down turns in my mood which were intense. So I naturally had a few such down turns (which was expected) and they came and went, only thing worth noting is that without the numbing effect of lithium they were more painful.

But all in all I seemed to be handling the decrease fairly well, even with a number of very stressful elements in my life situation (losing my job/being unemployed, ongoing addiction recovery, a recent near death experience, being broke and needing to live with parents while getting back on my feet, facing the rejection of the job hunt, the general state of the world (note, these were all in play before the decrease except for the job search)). I wasn't convinced that it was working out but I thought there was a chance that I would pull through to a new stability at the reduced dose.

That all changed when I got covid. Now I'm feeling kinda scared. I had never experienced that kind of insomnia before and was kind of freaked out by that feeling that I could potentially be going manic or slipping back to my old, very serious levels of depression. I really don't want to be on lithium because I feel like an utter shell of the person that I used to be while on it, because it makes me feel mentally impaired, kills my motivation and joy, and because it's a piece of shit fucking drug that ruined my thyroid and and might fuck up my kidneys someday. Need I say more? I've been through the gamut of psych meds and what I've found is that they just don't work very well. They can decrease the odds of killing yourself or running through the streets naked but they don't really make you into a happy successful person, and might block you off from parts of yourself that would help you become that. Ugh.

So basically my question is..

**Question: Did anyone else have a serious psychiatric flare up following a covid infection? Did it resolve itself on its own as time passed or did it require a new level of intervention?**

Bonus question: Have you ever attempted a medication decrease that failed but then you tried again at a later time when your life had settled more and then had long term success with it (defining long term success as > 1 year of mood stability).

**tl;dr** \- I tried decreasing my lithium 3 months ago (with medical support/supervision). It was going alright but then I got covid and now I feel kind of fucked up. Wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and if I should expect this to pass on its own as I've read and been told that covid can flare up your nervous system and cause or make depression, anxiety, etc. worse even for some time after initial infection.",hi wanted hear related experience whether normal covid weeks ago 30s expecting intense disruptive got sicker thought would lasted 5 days however sleep anxiety got thrown way whack never full manic episode life couple nights sleeping unlike funny feeling verge going direction doctor gave gabapentin sleep reduced welbutrin hoping decrease stimulating effects little week later starting sleep decently feeling pretty seriously depressed like periods desperation level intensity experienced years little bit backstory began seeking psychiatric care around 9 years ago severe depression point doctor diagnosed bipolar ii everyone family like bipolar ignored embraced diagnosis time got bipolar meds sort stabilized never really took away depression also left lot disruptive side effects time started feeling skeptical diagnosis example therapist working 9 years think remind bipolar patients conceptions map clearly past self wanted see could less medication successfully went seroquel seroquel course years seemingly without mood destabilized around 3 months ago asked p doc decrease lithium suggested going side note started wondering abnormally large jump psych med decrease think trusted suggestion carried decrease felt little panicky moments first month feeling went away sleep little bit lighter much thought real problem even highest levels medicated would still regular turns mood intense naturally turns expected came went thing worth noting without numbing effect lithium painful seemed handling decrease fairly well even number stressful elements life situation losing unemployed ongoing addiction recovery recent near death experience broke needing live parents getting back feet facing rejection job hunt general state world note play decrease except job search convinced working thought chance would pull new stability reduced dose changed got covid feeling kinda scared never experienced kind insomnia kind freaked feeling could potentially going manic slipping back old serious levels depression really want lithium feel like utter shell person used makes feel mentally impaired kills motivation joy piece shit fucking drug ruined thyroid might fuck kidneys someday need say gamut psych meds found work well decrease odds killing running streets naked really make happy successful person might block parts would help become ugh basically question question anyone else serious psychiatric flare following covid infection resolve time passed require new level intervention bonus question ever attempted medication decrease failed tried later time life settled long term success defining long term success 1 year mood stability tl dr tried decreasing lithium 3 months ago medical going alright got covid feel kind fucked wondering anyone else similar experience expect pass read told covid flare nervous system cause make depression anxiety etc worse even time initial infection
ydqtyx,2022-10-26 01:23:23,"Just want to know if anyone had a similar experience. I was diagnosed with bipolar pretty soon after I got COVID back in January 2022.

For background, I had never had COVID until that point. I had struggled with mental illness for over a decade though (I’m 27 now, and first started seeing a psychiatrist about age 14). I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Tried lots of medicines mostly SSRI. They all seemed to just make things worse. Eventually I gave up. I stopped getting treatment and went a few years not on any medicine and I was mostly fine, besides like occasional panic attacks and just generally not feeling great.

In January I got COVID and something changed drastically. I got extremely sick and I was basically confined to a bed for three weeks. I just wanted to get up and move on but when it came time to, I couldn’t. I feel like there is something keeping half my brain from working. I was always so sharp before. I actually had just graduated with a masters degree and suddenly I couldn’t remember people’s names. I also felt really aggressive. I stopped eating and sleeping and got in a huge fight with my boss at work and my doctor told me it was a manic episode and put me on a mood stabilizer. It did help. But I have always been curious if being sick caused these symptoms to be so intense. I quit my job and have pretty much isolated myself since.

zwg3dw,2022-12-27 07:50:56,"How about a year ago I came across a video of myself And I was happy silly funny, a bunch of things I'm not anymore. I've always tried to think about what was happening at that point in my life that could have changed but nothing seemed significant. Just an FYI, I rapid cycle so the time frame doesn't add up.

I've become more depressed since then. I recently found out through extensive research that COVID affects the same areas in our limbic system as bipolar. The prefrontal cortex and amygdala are just two that I can think of up top of my head.

I know that as we age with bipolar the symptoms change, we typically have less manic episodes, more depression and agitation.

I was thinking about it again recently because I suddenly became way more depressed than I've ever been. I started thinking back to the last time this happened and that's when it hit me. I recently contracted COVID again.

There's way more to this than I'm getting into right here, but if you want sources I'm more than happy to give it to you. Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, motor control function, memory, those are all things which bipolar disorder and COVID have in common. They work on the same areas of the brain.

I had been skeptical of the vaccine especially coming from a very small red city but after reading that part I started making active attempts to get the vaccine.

I had COVID last November and it cleared within the first week. I thought it was totally unrelated but I did kinda have a minor hypomanic onset near the end. Then I had another the month after, and a full blown hospitalization and manic episode this summer.

* I have my own space
* I walk on the beach at sunset almost every evening
* I finally have an eating schedule, and am back to a healthy weight
* I make enough money to survive
* I have kind and humble friends in all walks of life
* I now take my med everyday (I was very spotty for years)
* I’m grateful that I only have to take one med (Lamictal)

Life is good. I never thought I could create this good of a situation especially when I lost everything 3 years ago (business, home, dog, fiancé of 7 years, physical & emotional health…), due to COVID times/mega long hypomanic episode with a garnish of adderall. But I did it.

I have peace, but I don’t have:

* motivation
* drive
* curiosity
* emotional depth
* desire
* a reliable short term memory

I used to be the highly driven, crazy work ethic person. I had wild, groundbreaking ideas and could execute them. I had the adhd curiosity. I had the ability to hyperfocus outside of work and the desire to learn as much as I could about the world.

Of course, we all know the bad in there:

* over 500 all nighters
* a very long list of lovers
* substance abuse
* very unhealthy eating/unintentionally starving myself/not prioritizing basic human needs
* …and on and on

So, I don’t want to go back there. But there has to an in between. Right? There has to be.

I don’t want to languish for the rest of my life. I don’t want to “just survive” and waste my life in retail/service jobs.

I want to be a productive member of society. I want to grow. I want to have at least a little bit of motivation & curiosity about the world.

I’ve never been this stable though. I’ve never wanted to try going off meds so bad. I miss my brain.

If the neurotypicals can’t have it all, then it seems like we can’t either.

Hey, I’m Bipolar type I and I do not work and I cannot work. 

I am 32, rent my own 1 bed flat, and I am on full disability benefits, housing benefits and PIP (Uk)

I want all of you to know, if you are the same as me please don’t give yourself a hard time and think you should be working.

Bipolar is classed as a disability, in both the states and UK.

If you are in the UK, there is a reason why you were put in the venerable category for Covid jabs. A family member was even confused as to why I got my jabs way before them. It’s because bipolar disorder IS a disability.

You are fully eligible to apply for any disability funding. You are well within for right to ask for any additional support to be referred to through your doctors.

Ignore anyone who starts to reference any celebrities/doctors/scientists who constantly work that have bipolar. This is not a blanket statement that should be taken as fact.

Please believe me when I say that most humans with bipolar are unable to work at all. When you take that into account - anyjob roles I referenced are perhaps maybe 15% of all bipolar humans that have actually managed to gain a career and wealth. 

I often think of how much I could offer and be if I was able to access a private doctor but I understand and acknowledge that will never be the case.

EDIT - before I had a psychotic manic break, I was an inventory manager for American Apparel for 5 years, then an office manager for a large design agency, I was on an incredible career path and it all got taken away from me. Having said that, looking back, I am so incredibly proud of what I achieved (at a young age too!!)

q29iyp,2021-10-05 19:40:25,"Husband and I are both bipolar. We planned a weekend camping trip to a state park a couple hours away. We’re both treatment compliant, as in weekly-therapy-goers and take-our-meds-at-the-same-time-everyday-and-cheers-over-it types. 

We packed the car, planned it all out, figured it’d be a nice weekend just put ourselves in nature then we’d return to work after the weekend. I work remotely so I brought my laptop “just in case” something went wrong.

We get to the state park. There’s some kind of fall festival going on and it’s clearly not COVID safe. I half-seriously state, “We can always go to Montana and see Glacier National Park.”

Glacier National Park is 2000 miles away.

My husband, with a glimmer in his eye I haven’t seen in years, calls my bluff, “You’re right. We could always go to Glacier.”

Glacier National Park is 2000 miles away. 

“You’ll have to call out of work,” I joke, “and I’ll have to work on the road.”

Glacier National Park is 2000 miles away.

He calls his boss. His boss says he’ll find coverage. “No worries, have fun, you haven’t had a vacation in years.”

We make it there in three days, driving through the night, sleeping in shifts because, “If we don’t sleep, we might go manic, and sleep hygiene is important.” 

It’s breathtaking and everything we’ve ever dreamed of.

And windy. So windy that we can’t setup camp.

“Let’s rent a cabin, just for tonight, so we can get some good sleep. We don’t want to go manic.”

We are 2000 miles away.

A night turns into four more nights in the cabin because “I need the Internet access to work.”

We finally decide to leave, adding room to the journey home for five days of travel because, “We shouldn’t drive too much each day. We don’t want to go manic.”

We triumphantly drive 2000 miles home over the course of five days, as scheduled. We high five that we’re responsible adults in our thirties and definitely not manic.

We’re almost home. The credit card declines. 

We forgot to check if we could remotely afford this.

1ih653q,2025-02-03 19:33:34,"anyone experience frequent crying when inconsistent w/ meds?

hi (: so i'm diagnosed type 1 with psychotic features since frebruary 2020.

i'll admit these past few months i've been in a depressive episode fluctuating between mild and severe. because of this, i've started to become inconsistent with my mood stabilizer. lately, i've found myself being easily triggered into sobbing uncontrollably by seemingly insignificant events. 

for example, i was messing around with my boyfriend last night playing with a soccer ball in the living room. i played for eight years and was really good at it. it was my passion. because of covid, my senior season got cut short and i haven't played on a team since. during our unserious 1v1 defensive situation, he ended up ""megging"" me (kicking the ball between my legs, iykyk) and started laughing about how he was finally able to do it to me.

at first it was funny but then i increasingly became emotional. i started quickly withdrawing, sat down on the couch and when he asked what was wrong, i just started sobbing. i don't know why but the whole thing just caused so much pain. i told him how what happened reminded me of how rusty i am with the sport and how it was such a huge part of my identity. it was something that gave me a leg-up in the high school social scene as an ""overweight"" girl. i always thought people wouldn't view me as the associated stereotype (i.e. lazy, unfit, etc.) because i was an athlete. and now since i don't do it anymore and i've gained weight for other reasons, i'm just reduced to being defined by my weight.

he apologized profusely about ""taking the joke to far"" and promising not to do it anymore. but i kept telling him how i didn't know why i was crying and it had nothing to do with him.

stuff like this has been going on for the past few weeks and i don't know why. can anyone relate?",anyone experience frequent crying inconsistent meds hi diagnosed type 1 psychotic features since frebruary admit past months depressive episode fluctuating mild severe started become inconsistent mood stabilizer lately found easily triggered sobbing uncontrollably seemingly insignificant events example messing around boyfriend last night playing soccer ball living room played eight years really good passion covid senior season got cut short played team since unserious 1v1 defensive situation ended megging kicking ball legs iykyk started laughing finally able first funny increasingly became emotional started quickly withdrawing sat couch asked wrong started sobbing know whole thing caused much pain told happened reminded rusty sport huge part identity something gave high school social scene overweight girl always thought people would view associated stereotype lazy unfit etc athlete since anymore gained weight reasons reduced defined weight apologized profusely taking joke far promising anymore kept telling know crying nothing stuff like going past weeks know anyone relate

1dyh77u,2024-07-08 14:08:46,"I don’t know where to even begin. I finally received a diagnosis of Bipolar I. The reason why I say finally is because I’ve been asking professionals for over a decade if I have it. My brother has it. But even before I knew he had it, I knew something was off. The clinical depression diagnosis I had as a kid never really seemed to fit. 

I was then diagnosed about 4 years ago with C-PTSD. But my therapist says that wasn’t correct. Perhaps it was somewhat of my fault to get this diagnosis at 36 years old, perhaps I wasn’t being honest enough.

My therapist advised me to quit my job because I worked in a nursing home, constantly surrounded by death. The fact that we are understaffed constantly since the beginning of the COVID pandemic and the fast pace environment triggered my mania, among other things in my life. So I’m scrambling for the past few weeks, trying to get on social security and find some source of income. I feel absolutely broken right now. I’ve been irritable, lashing out, then crying. Oh and to top it all off I had to bury my darling beloved cat yesterday. So I’m even more of a mess. They increased my dose of lamotrigine since the diagnosis and also put me on 50 mg of quetiapine. It’s helping me sleep, but I’m still adjusting.

Half of me was shocked to get the diagnosis just because it’s always shocking to hear a new diagnosis I guess. But the other half of me felt somewhat validated. I’ve been doing a lot of reflection, looking back on certain parts in my life and realizing I was probably manic, especially in my early twenties.

1ejuib3,2024-08-04 07:51:11,"BP1 here, and this spring I had a moderate episode in which I threatened to sue my employer, told coworkers they were conspiring against me, and ripped the hitch wiring off my RV out of stupidity and being distracted by the illness. But also: I was permanently hungover the entire time.

I think in the past twenty years the longest I’ve been sober was five days and that was Covid. I’ve been a functional alcoholic: high paying remote job where I could start drinking at 2pm and no one could tell. I’d drink heavy (5-6 7% IPAs) til 8pm, then finish off with some water so the headache wasn’t too bad the next day. All this time I kept having severe recurring depression in which all I wanted was to kms.

The morning I broke the RV hitch I was hung over and depressed, and something snapped in me: I wasn’t going to drink anymore. As my doctor had been telling me, I wasn’t giving the chance for the meds to work if I’m piling on depressants every days. So I quit cold turkey: no support groups, just my wife and willpower. 

First few days sucked. Dopamine and sugar crash made the lingering depression worse. There was no “reward” awaiting me at 2pm. By the end of the week, however, my depression had mostly subsided.

It’s been two months now, something I never thought I’d be able to do, and it turns out the meds work better this way too. I’m more present. Waking up still sucks because I’m old AF and my body hurts, but knowing that I won’t be hungover is huge. The biggest battle has been boredom from where I used to fill in time with alcohol.

1f143kd,2024-08-25 14:05:25,"Hi everyone! I want to thank this community for helping me not feel alone.  I want to share my story since I never met another bipolar person in my life who could relate to me.

After struggling with depression since 12 & being hospitalized for 3 attempts over the years, I finally reached a great place in my life at 27.  I was engaged to my best friend & soul mate.  I had a great job, was physically fit, mentally sound, good with my family, and generally loved myself and my life.  I was a outgoing & social person who could make with friends with anyone.

In Dec 2019 I had my first manic episode which ended in Jan 2021 when I was hospitalized and diagnosed with BP 1.  It began when I suddenly and without reason ended my engagement. I immediately joined dating apps and was going out and hooking up with people.  I later caused an incident at work which caused me to get fired eventually.  During peak Covid I traveled all over the country.  I spent 80k that year on myself, gifts, traveling, etc.  I did many other reckless and dangerous things like most manic episodes I've read, but never got in trouble. I felt unstoppable while ruining my life. 

After it ended, I had another attempt and since have spent last 4 years living with my mom and haven't worked & became a recluse.  Life doesn't seem real to me because of depersonalization & derealization.  I have constant SI and just have given up. I've been on numerous combinations of medications over past 4 years.  I just can't let go of who I was, who I am now, and who I could have been.  These thoughts are a cancer of my mind.

2 Questions:

1. I am blessed with a very vivid memory which is a blessing & curse.  I constantly have intrusive memories (good & bad) pop up in my head like a movie skipping to random scenes of my life. Does anyone else experience this?  
2. How do we move on when we know we can't be as happy as were? Why live by accepting that you can't ever strive to be too happy for the fear of losing it all again?

1g417ae,2024-10-15 01:11:42,"Oh god. I don’t even know where or how to start. 

I’m in Florida and while my home is safe, my job is not. The hospital at which I work is flooded. I can’t specify too much for obvious reasons, but I work on a specialized team that is contracted by the hospital, and due to the damage (and the cost of my team), the program is being cut. 

Found out today that my fiancé’s job doesn’t have enough money to reopen after the storm. So we’re both unemployed. 

I have the opportunity (kind of) to interview at a hospital where I used to work. Two issues:
1. The other candidate is my current coworker who is also out of a job, with four kids, and is two years my senior in terms of experience at this hospital. I met her originally at this hospital where she trained me, to put it in perspective.
2. I was manic as fuck while I was there. It was COVID, and I was in the COVID unit frequently performing ECMOs, and what that is doesn’t matter. The point was, I wasn’t sleeping, I was always in fight or flight, people were dying, and my charge nurse was driving me up a fucking wall. We fought often, partly because she was making the wrong calls but mostly because I was off my rocker and pissed off for any reason at all. 

Well, this charge nurse is now the unit manager who will be conducting my interview. My best friend who still works there was approached by her and was asked “why did (my name) leave???  I feel like it was on bad terms.” So I know she’s going to ask me. 

The reason I left was because I was at the top of the parking garage trying to will myself over the edge. Thank god I won that battle, but I went to my (then) manager and said “Something is wrong, I need help because all I want to do is die and I think working here is the reason.” My manager at the time hugged me and cried with me while I figured out a plan. She didn’t end my employment for two weeks after, to make it look like I put in notice, but everybody kind of knew what was going on. 

There were other issues, but the main issue will be my interviewer tomorrow, and my competition is somebody more worthy, and I am now a 0 income household with a $2.3k monthly rent. That’s just rent.

First of all, i've been recently diagnosed and everything is a little strange and foggy for me, my country dosent really offer GREAT mental health services, so i feel a little lost. For most of my life i just tought i had depression, but after my father death due to covid i went thourgh a series of exams: first i was diagnosed with ADHD, then depression and then finally, BPD Type 2. Im taking my meds but sometimes i just cant afford it.

  
Well, to the topic at hand: My friends at most dont seem to mind, but i have a fear that someday they will just get tired off and distance themselves from me. due to the depressive episodes i've gone thourgh weeks and month without seem them and i have a fear the'll think i dont like to hang with them or something.

  
My Family... is more complicated, after my father died it was just me and my Mom. Thing seem to work, mostly. She is a complicated and had a serie of serious health problems. She cant work anymore so i take the load off her as a Video Editor.I love her, and she loves me, but she critizes me for ""being too weak, too sad"" and ""thinking too much like a woman sometimes""

  
And finally, the reason i came to post here: Before the diagnose i started dating this girl. She seemed perfect, we have so much im common, we used to talk a lot, see each other a lot. she's diagnosed with depression, so i guess we found some common ground in our melancholy. But she grew a little distant, even forggeting my birthday while i was in the hospital, so i guess i grew a little resentful, shee seemed to be so happy with other people but never wanted to hang out with my, so one day, in the middle of a crisis, i lash out on her, and she still seems to hate me for it. I tried to explain to her that i was not in a good headspace and i was vomiting feelings i held with me for so long, and something were just non-logical decisions that my head took from the fear she would leave me, but she didnt seem to understand.

  
Anyways, sry for bad english (not my first language) but i wanted to know how to deal with people around me. Mostly so i dont hurt them, since i dont think they'll ever understand what goes thourgh my head.

I’ve been on my current mood stabilizer for 4.5 years and despite my bp1 diagnosis and a previous severe mania, have been relatively stable since. I have had some ups and down, and am currently dealing with a hypomania that I’m finding uncomfortable, undesirable, more extreme. I even took some ‘emergency’ meds to bring down the mania, which hasn’t been necessary since early 2021 (it helped a lot and i’m feeling more balanced than i was for the two weeks before this).
I cant get my psychs recent comment out of my head, though. She said “i’ve been seeing you a year and this is the second time you’ve been hypomanic like this. Ideally, i wouldn’t want you to experience anything like this while medicated. It’s making me consider tapering you onto a different mood stabilizer.” That feels bonkers to me, and very black and white. I should /never/ have an episode while medicated? That doesnt feel realistic… Am i delulu for feeling like being a bit racey for a couple weeks isn’t a huge deal?
For now, I am taking care of myself, my sleep, lowering caffeine intake and doing my best to think through my actions, no impulsiveness etc. I do not want to change meds, as I currently have low side effects and dont want to risk that changing.

1gtiwks,2024-11-17 11:37:14,"Just diagnosed. Not sure how to feel 

Hi. I’m a 21 f and I’ve just been given my second diagnosis of bipolar II. I’m really frustrated but also relieved. Here’s a bit of my story.

When I was 18 I started college at a top university here in the US. Super prestigious and I worked my ass off since I was 13 to get there, swearing off any and all fun and enjoyment. 

COVID hit my junior year of HS. I went from a super innocent girl, to all the sudden smoking dab pens every day, all the time. It was so hard to cope with all the loss I faced that year.

Anyways when I entered my freshman year of college I had just quit smoking and went through CHS, which is essentially when your body cannot deal with you quitting weed. I threw up everyday and was super underweight and so anxious I don’t even know how I survived.

When I finally got settled into school, I started to embrace having fun and started smoking again. It all snowballed, and the final blow was me being jumped by a homeless person. It wasn’t even the actual crime, but how everyone I cared about responded. Nobody gave a shit.

Anyways, I soon entered my first of eventually 3 manic episodes that occurred within the last 3 years. 

I had shitty therapists and psychiatrists. I was on and off 10 different meds over the last few years. 

I had to leave my dream school after two years. By that point, I had endured an extremely dangerous relationship where I was relentlessly abused and manipulated by a man who was a diagnosed narcissist.

I lost every friend I ever had. My family almost disowned me. I have been through hell and back. I came close to being hospitalized twice and dealt with relentless SI and almost attempted. Don’t even know how I’m here today honestly. 

I’m leaving out a lot of the crazy manic stories, because they could each take up pages and pages of detail lol. But they were bad. Real bad.

I’ve also dealt with extremely intense depressive episodes. I’m normally a talkative, somewhat outgoing person. I’ve had many depressive episodes that have lasted up to 6 months. Consisting of no showering, no talking, no thoughts. I was a shell of a person. Nothing.

I’m been given previous diagnoses of BPD and bipolar before. I related to both, but BPD never seemed to explain my cycles of depression and mania.

I was depressed most of this summer, but not as bad as my previous episodes. 

After so much trauma therapy and hard work, I’ve reached a point of relative stability despite the depression. 

But I finally found a therapist who specializes in bipolar. I reached out because I’m afraid. I am so terrified of being manic again. Over the last year I’ve worked so hard to get where I am. 

I’m in a loving year long relationship. Me and my parents are in a really good place. I’ve started to go back to school.

But I’m started to feel happy again. More energy. And I’m just so scared. I feel like nobody understands this. So I’m finally trying to access a community of where maybe I can find similar experiences.

Im feeling a mix of emotions now.

I’m hoping I can prevent anymore manic or depressive episodes from derailing my life. I’m hoping this diagnosis can help me keep myself safe. I’m just scared.

1ebcz7r,2024-07-24 16:20:04,"I'm lost in where I'm going and what I'm doing. Everything just feels so far out of reach and practically unobtainable. I'm 24, moved back in with my mom, unemployed, and not in college.

Everyone my age seems to be doing so much better than I am, they're graduated and starting careers or families. I'm in the same exact spot I was about a year ago.

Prior to covid, I felt like I was on the right track. I had medications that worked, a well paying job, and I had just completed my first term in college with an offer for am academic scholarship. And then everything just started going downhill.

I had to be hospitalized due to ideation, and then I had to reduce my work hours, and now I can't keep a job longer than 3 months. Sometimes I'm lucky to even get to the 3 month mark.

This whole last year feels like a complete waste. I thought that if I could just get approved for disability, then maybe I could climb myself out. But I got denied, and it's like what I'm experiencing shouldn't actually be as bad as I'm making it. My friends and family are similar too, they think I should go back to college and get back into the workforce. But I'm doing nothing each day just to keep myself mostly stable and I'm still so stressed. My episodes seem never ending and I'm so tired.

I finally graduated from community college. A few years ago. I think it was the fall of 2020. 

It took me 8 years to get an associates degree

So many times my mental health took over or something trauma related happened and I couldn’t finish a lot of semesters. I had to take English four times just to pass. (English is also my first language) 

During Covid I was hypomanic and I had the great idea that I was going to transfer to a four year college (yeah right) I had one class left so I decided since work was closed and the class was online I’d do it. 

I passed

All graduations were put on hold and eventually they combined the 2020 and 2021 graduation to one big PowerPoint. 

I got to see my name go across the screen

Thought I’d feel like there’d be more. I thought I’d get a congratulations. I thought maybe my family would say more than “that’s great”. I thought I was worth more than just a fucking name on a screen

1fvbb1t,2024-10-03 11:03:23,"For me it's I accepted it. I'd been properly diagnosed with Bipolar disorder roughly 4-5 years ago during Covid-19. The old me was quite toxic to people around me. I grew up put into the parent/care-taker role of my older sister on the spectrum. Oddly I am also on the spectrum but I was put in the role of someone responsible for her which was a huge problem during teens because I'd have to deal with my own shit and hers. It built resentment and it did not help the fact that I was surrounded by either manipulative or toxic people.

When my mania flared I could not pause my words and I could talk for days mostly negative about someone or some situation I was upset over. Problems ranged from talking about something someone close to me or said to me essentially I being a loudmouth. People would take advantage of this situation talk to me about some topic they want trying to make me say or do what they want. It was exhausting but it made me see how things works in this world. Some people will try their best to be in the better light even through lying or telling half-truths.

I can't cook a proper meal or multi task at all anymore, I frustrate people with how long I take to do things, I'm at a point where I'm just not coping. I tried to return to work and couldn't last a day because I just can't do things that I used to and kept making stupid mistakes. 

I'm also constantly dropping things and hurting myself (started several fires through leaving things on/turning on the wrong hobs) 

I also have autism and chronic fatigue syndrome and have always had issues here and there but since the manic episode ended, I'm just not the person I was at all. I feel embarrassed by how much I struggle to do any task because my brain just can't connect the dots anymore. It feels physically uncomfortable to try and concentrate on anything. 

I'm not saying any of these things for sympathy, what I'm just trying to understand is has my manic episode given me brain damage or something because that's what it genuinely feels like and am I alone or has this happened to others too? 

Is it possible that this is a result of bipolar?

That sucks.

The same is for cold medicine.

I remember one time I had Covid and I think I only took pain relievers and sore throat lozenges. I was frustrated I couldn't take cold/flu meds. I messed up not contacting my primary or my psychiatrist on what to do about my med issue.

I have been having headaches on/off since July. Pain relievers don't help hence why I need to the two meds I was prescribed.

But I'm too scared.

I'm diagnosed with Type 2. I don't really experience hypomanic or mixed episode symptoms. They seem to be too mild for me to notice (I'm also being tested for ADHD and I heard these two conditions share symptoms) but it seems mood stabilizers work for me. I think mood stabilizers are sometimes used for unipolar depression however I don't want to keep going on and on about this.

Honestly my diagnosis is confusing since I also experience chronic depression but my providers still think I'm bipolar.

I'm just frustrated with problems bipolar disorder can cause like it limiting the meds you can take.

Prevention of symptoms would be nice enut I guess the real reason I'm scared is because I don't know what to do if I experience manic symptoms. I'm worried if I end up experiencing a full-blown manic episode I fear I won't be able to go to the hospital. 

What if I experience a hypomanic or mixed episode?

Treat me like I'm a newly diagnosed with bipolar disorder. 

It's wise to the ask questions now then later right?

1anllzq,2024-02-10 11:34:22,"A couple years ago, I had a severe manic episode due to what was then an undiagnosed bipolar condition. It was so bad that I ended up getting in trouble with the law, twice. The first set of charges got expunged and I'm working on the second set.

When I got to NC it took a couple months because I was still having the episode but I got a job at UPS. Did that for a couple of months, got another temp job packing bottles, now I'm working for a vending company. I did a couple interviews to try to get back into IT but I keep bombing them and it feels like I know nothing as a system administrator (which is what i was for a year before switching) or a Cybersecurity analyst which is one of the reasons why I quit, Imposter syndrome hit me hard.
